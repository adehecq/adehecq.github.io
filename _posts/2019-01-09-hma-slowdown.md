title: High Mountain Asia glaciers slowdown

In a [recent study](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41561-018-0271-9), I analyzed changes in ice flow velocity for all glaciers in High Mountain Asia over the period 2000-2017 and showed that most glaciers are slowing down in response to a warming climate. I further demonstrated that the slowdown can be largely explained by the change in thickness implying that decadal and regional changes in ice flow are largely insensitive to changes in conditions at the bed of the glacier and can be well estimated from ice thickness change and slope alone.
