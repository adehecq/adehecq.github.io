title: Decadal slowdown of land-terminating glaciers in Greenland
---

In a [study](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature15722) led by [A. Tedstone](https://adehecq.github.io), we showed that ice motion across an 8,000 km<sup>2</sup> land-terminating region of the west Greenland Ice Sheet margin was 12% slower in 2007–14 compared with 1985– 94, despite a 50% increase in surface meltwater production. This is in opposition with previous studies suggesting an acceleration of the ice sheet in response to enhanced surface melting and shows that this sector of the ice-sheet is more resilient to surface melting than previously thought.
