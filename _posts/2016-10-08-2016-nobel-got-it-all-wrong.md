In a wonderfully ironic [post](http://huet.blog.lemonde.fr/2016/10/07/le-nobel-de-chimie-2016-avait-tout-faux/)
(in French), the journalist Sylvestre Huet describes the life and career of
Jean-Pierre Sauvage, who recently won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Jean-Pierre Sauvage studied chemistry in Strasbourg, wrote his
PhD thesis in Strasbourg, after which he obtained a permanent position in...
Strasbourg, where he stayed until his retirement in 2009. This is a disastrous
career according to today's standards: he didn't go to the US for a PostDoc, and
he chose to follow his intuition and worked on the same topic for decades.

Stability, freedom in research, and job security are essential
ingredients for new discoveries and scientific success. Although many
politicians are really quick in congratulating "their" scientists when they are
successful, they are very slow in understanding that the current funding policy
in most European countries is based on the exact opposite principles: mobility,
job precarity, competitivity. All this is leading to fraudulent, quick n' dirty
research at the origin of the many scientific scandals in the recent years.

A brilliant example of this contra-productive policy is the Austrian
"Kettenvertragsregelung", or the regulation of "chained" contracts. Originally
written in order to [protect the university employees](http://www.studieren.at/news/kettenvertragsregelung-sorgt-immer-noch-fuer-unsichere-arbeitsbedingungen-an-oesterreichischen-hochschulen),
this law constrains the
universities to hire the researchers which have been employed on soft money for
more than six years. In practice, the university won't
accept to sign any new contract based on external grants with a person who might
exceed this six years limit. Many brilliant people are put under terrible
pressure because of this regulation and eventually see themselves forced to leave
Austria and look for job elsewhere (why not in Brexit Britain, I've heard
there are [plenty of opportunities](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/sep/25/brexit-may-force-15-of-staff-at-uk-universities-to-leave-warns-group)
on the island).

I wonder if Jean-Pierre Sauvage would have had the same career today as he had 40
years ago.

I doubt it.
