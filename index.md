**I am a postdoctoral researcher working on mountain glaciers changes from satellite observations.** I study the response of glaciers to climate change over the last 50 years using a combination of satellite images (optical and radar) and glacier models. Areas of interest include: High-Mountain Asia, European Alps, Arctic. 

I am currently based in the Earth Science division of the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/EarthScience/index.cfm), where I am employed as a Caltech postodoctoral scholar on a project aiming at estimating the glaciers contribution to sea level rise since the 1970s using historical satellite imagery. I am also studying the dynamics response of glaciers to these changes using surface ice flow velocities derived from feature-tracking of repeat imagery.

I have co-developed **GeoRaster** and **GeoUtils**, two Python packages for working with geographic rasters and vectors. Take a look at the [blog post](georaster-released), [documentation](http://georaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geoutils/georaster) for more details.
