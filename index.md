**I am a postdoctoral researcher working on mountain glacier changes from satellite observations.** I study the response of glaciers to climate change over the last 50 years using a combination of satellite images (optical and radar) and glacier models. Areas of interest include: High-Mountain Asia, European Alps, Arctic. 

I am currently based at the [VAW glaciology](https://vaw.ethz.ch/en/research/glaciology.html) department of ETH Zürich, Switzerland. My current project aims at estimating the glaciers contribution to sea level rise since the 1970s using historical satellite imagery. I am also studying the dynamics response of glaciers to these changes using surface ice flow velocities derived from feature-tracking of repeat imagery. Check out for example the [ITS LIVE project](https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/)!

I have co-developed **GeoRaster** and **GeoUtils**, two Python packages for working with geographic rasters and vectors. Take a look at the [blog post](georaster-released), [documentation](http://georaster.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/geoutils/georaster) for more details.
